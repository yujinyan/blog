In our Laravel backend project, there is a `User` class, which is among one of the first classes created. Over the years, it has accumulated all sorts of business-related methods, degenerating into thousands of lines of unmanageable mess. This is a typical example of an all-knowing [god object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object).

Defining methods directly on the `User` class seems natural in many cases. For example, to enable [Laravel's elegant notification API](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/notifications), we put a trait on the `User` model and call it like this:

```php
$user->notify(new OrderShipped($order));
```

This style is fluent and intuitive, and many developers on the project have followed suit and put many business logic in the `User` model. Unfortunately, it does not scale very well, as almost every piece of business logic effectively interacts with the `User`.

So in larger projects, we may want to do a cleaner architecture. Suppose we want to track the following status of a user in a `FollowService`, we may come up with something like this:

```kotlin
class FollowService(
  private followRepo: FollowRepository
) {
  fun isFollowedBy(user1: User, user2: User): Boolean {
    // Call method on `followRepo` ...
  }
}
```

Now we can check if `user2` has followed `user1` by calling

```kotlin
followSevice.isFollowedBy(user1, user2)
```

However, this design leaves something to be desired. When consuming this API, we could get confused about the order of these two parameters. Which user should come first? It's reasonable to assume that the subject comes first, but to be sure, we'll have to check the documentation on the method. Such inconvenience disrupts our coding flow.

As it turns out, Kotlin's extension methods can help us solve this issue elegantly. In Kotlin, we can define a method as an extension on another existing type, even in the context of a class. So we can rewrite the method definition to:

```kotlin
class FollowService(
  private followRepo: FollowRepository
) {
    fun User.isFollowedBy(other: User): Boolean {
      // `user1` available as implicit `this`
    }
}
```

And we invoke the method in this way:

```kotlin
val star: User = userRepo.findOneStar()
val fan: User = userRepo.findOneFan()

with(followService) {
  assertThat(star.isFollowedby(fan)).isTrue()
}
```

To call the method, we first grab an instance of `FollowService`, probably via dependency injection. Then we use Kotlin's standard library function `with` or `apply` to open a block. Inside the block, there is an implicit `this`, referring to the `FollowService` instance. But since the `isFollowedBy` method is defined as an extension on the `User` type, we can only call it on a `User` instance. If we move the `isFolloweBy` method call out of the `with` block, our IDE will complain that the method cannot be found.

In this way, our business logic lives in service classes. These classes usually involve some side effects like expensive network requests. We don't want database calls to hide inside some innocent-looking getter methods on our models. So when we call services, we want to do it explicitly. Using this approach, in order to access a service's functionality, we must first demarcate a _scope_ in which methods of the service are defined. Inside the scope, our business entities are empowered by the service to perform specific business logic. We have the choice to make the methods appear as if they were defined on the entities. As our `FollowService` example shows, this can sometimes lead to more fluent and ergonomic API designs.

Note that it's also possible to achieve a bit of extra fluency by using the `infix` keyword. And our method call becomes:

```kotlin
assertThat(star isFollowedBy fan).isTrue()
```
