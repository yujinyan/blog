<PullQuote className="mt-16" emoji="😍😍😍😍😍" dontPull>
  A pragmatic general software engineering book full of useful advice.
  It covers a lot of ground, from writing code to team communication.
  An experienced developer probably already knows much of the material,
  but may still enjoy the anecdotes and punch lines.
</PullQuote>

Here are some helpful tips I highlighted, annotated with some of my thoughts.

## Invest regularly in knowledge portfolio

- Learn at least one new programming language every year.
- Read a technical book each month.
- Read nontechnical books, too.
- Take classes.

I feel these goals are well-worth putting into action.
The second point is the motivation for the bookshelf page of this blog.

## Engineering Daybooks

> ... a kind of journal in which they recorded what they did, things they learned, sketches of ideas, readings from meters: basically anything to do with their work.


Now I’m keeping this kind of journal inside Notion, where I paste links, screenshots and scribble down thoughts. I also try to organize the notes on a weekly basis.

The author advises using pen and paper, but I think that’s inconvenient.

## Critically analyze what you read and hear

> Beware of the zealots who insist their dogma provides the *only* answer.

Many undergo this stage where we are overly enthusiastic about one specific piece of technology. It’s important to be open-minded.

I feel coming from a humanities background may have an edge here, as we are more used to the fact that there are many solutions to a problem.

Writing software is mainly about weighing pros and cons of different solutions and striking the right balance.

## Uniform Access Principle

> All services offered by a module should be available through a uniform notation, which does not betray whether they are implemented through storage or through computation.
> <cite>Bertrand Meyer</cite>


[bliki: UniformAccessPrinciple](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UniformAccessPrinciple.html)

Kotlin provides direct support for this principle through object property. For example, the `length` property of the `Line` class is first implemented through computation.

```kotlin
class Line(
  val start: Point,
  val end: Point,
) {
  val length get() = start.distanceTo(end) // highlight-line
}
```

Later, we’d like to store the result inside a field. We can evolve the class like this:

```kotlin
class Line(
  val start: Point,
  val end: Point,
) {
  val length = start.distanceTo(end) // highlight-line
}
```

In either way, the API looks the same to the client.

## Balance resources

> The function or object that allocates a resource should be responsible for deallocating it.


The key idea is that the opening and closing of a resource should happen locally in the same place. Further, it’s even better to leverage good interface design and language features.

Example: [Using the Effect Hook - React](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html#tip-use-multiple-effects-to-separate-concerns)

```jsx
class FriendStatusWithCounter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0, isOnline: null };
    this.handleStatusChange = this.handleStatusChange.bind(this);
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    document.title = `You clicked ${this.state.count} times`;
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(this.props.friend.id, this.handleStatusChange); // highlight-line
  }

  componentDidUpdate() {
    document.title = `You clicked ${this.state.count} times`;
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(this.props.friend.id, this.handleStatusChange); // highlight-line
  }

  handleStatusChange(status) {
    this.setState({ isOnline: status.isOnline });
  }
  // ...
```

With the hook API:

```jsx
function FriendStatusWithCounter(props) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`; // highlight-line
  });

  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    function handleStatusChange(status) {
      setIsOnline(status.isOnline);
    }

    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange); // highlight-line
    return () => {
      ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange); // highlight-line
    };
  });
  // ...
}
```

Notice the hook API helps to co-locate the opening and closing of resources in a single method.

## Concurrency vs. Parallelism

> Concurrency is a software mechanism, and parallelism is a hardware concern.


## Refactoring

> Software is more like gardening—it is more organic than concrete.


## Test-driven development

> Thinking about writing a test for our method made us look at it from the outside, as if we were a client of the code, and not its author.


Java applications seem to have the tradition of defining interfaces even if there is only one implementation. Such interface-first approach also makes us think about how the API looks from the outside. However, it could lead to a more rigid structure.

## Agile

> In fact, whenever someone says “do this, and you”ll be agile,” they are wrong. By definition.


Don’t lose sight of the true meaning of agility. Remember the values from the original manifesto:

- ***Individuals and interactions*** over processes and tools
- ***Working software*** over comprehensive documentation
- ***Customer collaboration*** over contract negotiation
- ***Responding to change*** over following a plan

## The requirements

> In our experience, this initial statement of need is not an absolute requirement.
> The client may not realize this, but it is really an invitation to explore.
