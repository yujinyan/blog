<LeetCode id={300} />

Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the
order of the remaining elements. For example, `[3,6,2,7]` is a subsequence of the array `[0,3,1,6,2,2,7]`.


## Key Intuition

To build the recurrence relation, we could ask ourselves whether the answer for $n - 1$ elements help us solve the entire sequence.

Suppose we know the longest increasing sequence in $(S_0, S_1, ..., S_{n-1})$ is of length $5$, and that $S_n = 8$. Will the longest increasing subsequence of $S$ be $5$ or $6$? It depends on whether the length-$5$ sequence ends with a value less than $8$.

Therefore, we really need to check every number $(S_0, S_1,...S_j)$ where $j < n$ and see whether $S_n > S_j$.

## Code

```java
public int lengthOfLIS(int[] nums) {
  int result = 1;
  int dp[] = new int[nums.length];
  Arrays.fill(dp, 1);

  for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
      if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
        dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
      }
    }
    result = Math.max(dp[i], result);
  }

  return result;
}
```
