Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest common subsequence.

A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

```shell
Example:

Input: text1 = "abcbdab", text2 = "bdcaba"
Output: 4
Explanation:
The longest common subsequence is "bcba" and its length is 4.
```

## Code

```java
public int longestCommonSubsequence(String text1, String text2) {
  int m = text1.length(), n = text2.length();
  int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1];
  for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    char c1 = text1.charAt(i - 1);
    for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
      char c2 = text2.charAt(j - 1);
      if (c1 == c2) {
        dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1; // highlight-line
      } else {
        dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]); // highlight-line
      }
    }
  }
  return dp[m][n];
}
```

## State transition

$$
dp[i][j] = \begin{cases}
dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1            & s[i] = s[j]  \\
max(dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j]) & s[i] \not = s[j]
\end{cases}
$$
