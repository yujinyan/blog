<LeetCode id={338} />

Given a non-negative integer number **num**.
For every number **i** in the range **0 ≤ i ≤ num**
calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 2
Output: [0,1,1]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
```

## Code

```java
public int[] countBits(int num) {
  int[] dp = new int[num + 1];
  for (int i = 0; i <= num; i++) {
    if (num & 1 == 0) { // even
      dp[i] = dp[i >> 1]; // highlight-line
    } else {
      dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1; // highlight-line
    }
  }
  return dp;
}
```

## Intuition

How do we get the result at `dp[i]` based on previous results?

There are two cases:

- When the number `i` is even, the least significant bit is `0`. If we right shift `i` by `1`, we effectively drop the trailing `0`, and the set bit count remains the same.
- When the number `i` is odd, compare it with the previous number, which is even. Numerically, `i` is 1 greater than `i - 1`, and the set bit count is also 1 greater.

```kotlin
0  | 0000 0000
1  | 0000 0001
2  | 0000 0010
3  | 0000 0011
4  | 0000 0100
5  | 0000 0101
```
