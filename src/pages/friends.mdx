Most authors nowadays publish their articles on platforms like WeChat, Juejin, or Medium.
Unfortunately, their content sometimes gets lost in a sea of clickbaity ads
that try to sell you programming tutorials by exploiting people's anxieties.
Even worse, many articles are locked inside a [walled garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform).

Therefore, it's delightful to see there are still people out there,
tinkering with technologies of the Open Web and presenting their passion with a personal touch.

This is a compilation of such personal blog sites that I have come across and found inspiring.
I hope this list can help you discover more sites like this one.

### [Stay Hungry Stay Foolish - Edward Elric's Blog](https://edward40.com/)
*Web Development, Rust, Programming Languages.*
I am a simple person. Whenever I see a site with that gorgeous Novela theme,
I try to add it to this list ;-).

### [Prin Blog](https://printempw.github.io)
*Fullstack Development.*
Prin says he's obsessed with layout and typography. I can testify to that.
