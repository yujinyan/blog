  # Friends

  Most authors nowadays publish their articles on platforms like WeChat, Juejin, or Medium.
  Unfortunately, their content sometimes get lost in a sea of clickbaity ads
  that try to sell you programming tutorials by exploiting people's anxiety.
  Even worse, many articles are locked inside a [walled garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform).

  Therefore, it's delightful to see there are still people our there,
  tinkering with technologies of the Open Web and presenting their passion with a personal touch.

  This is a compilation of such personal blog sites that I have come across and found inspiring.
  I hope this list can help you discover more sites like this one.

  ### [Stay Hungry Stay Foolish - Edward Elric's Blog](https://edward40.com/)
  Rust, Web development.
  I am a simple person.
  Whenever I see a site with that beautiful Novela theme, I try to add it to this list ;-).

  ### [PRIN BLOG](https://printempw.github.io/friends/)
  Fullstack dev. The author says he's obsessed with layout and typography. I can testify to that.
