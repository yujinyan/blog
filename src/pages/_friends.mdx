Most authors nowadays publish their articles on platforms like WeChat, Juejin, or Medium.
Unfortunately, their content sometimes gets lost in a sea of clickbaity ads.
Even worse, many articles are locked inside a [walled garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform).

It's delightful to see there are still people out there,
tinkering with technologies of the Open Web and presenting their passion with a personal touch.

This is a compilation of such personal blog sites that I have come across and found inspiring.
I hope this list can help you discover more sites like this one.
