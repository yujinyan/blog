## Up and running

```java
docker run -it --rm --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:3-management
```

The web management UI is available at [http://localhost:15672](http://localhost:15672). The default username and password are both `guest`.

[Messaging with RabbitMQ](https://spring.io/guides/gs/messaging-rabbitmq/) is a very basic Hello World example for Spring Boot integration. To use it in a more production-ready setting, it's mandary to refer to the [Spring AMQP reference documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-amqp/docs/current/reference/html).

## AMQP

AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) is an application layer protocol for messaging middleware. RabbitMQ primarily supports the AMQP 0-9-1 model. The protocol mainly concerns the following three *AMQP entities*.

### Exchange, queue and binding

Messages are published to an *exchange* and consumed from a *queue*. A queue can subscribe to exchanges by using *bindings*. When a message arrives at an exhange, it will be routed to different queues based on:

- the routing key in the mesasge, and
- the type of exchange.

### Routing

The four basic types of exchange are:

- Direct exchange
- Fanout exchange
- Topic exchange
- Headers exchange

In this way, the publisher and subscriber are further decoupled from each other and can be adapted to different workflows flexibly. The routing mechanisim may look overwhelming at first sight, so we are sticking with the simplest Direct Exchange for the time being. In this case, the message will be routed to the subscribing queues with the same routing key.

### Declarative configuration with Spring AMQP

With Spring AMQP, we can configure the required AMQP entities in the message broker by registering them as beans in the application context.  At runtime, Spring AMQP will issue requests to the broker and create them. I like this declarative approach. In some way, it's like Kubernetes without the nasty YAML configurations.

```kotlin
@Configuration
class RabbitMqConfig {
  @Bean
  fun domainEventExchange() = DirectExchange("domain_events")

  @Bean
  fun queues(listeners: List<DomainEventListener>) = Declarables(
    listeners.map {
      QueueBuilder.durable(it::class.simpleName).build()
    }
  )

  @Bean
  fun bindings(listeners: List<DomainEventListener>) = Declarables(
    queues.zip(listeners) { queue, listener ->
      BindingBuilder.bind(queue).to(domainEventExchange()).with(listener.topic)
    }
  )
}

interface DomainEventListener {
  val topic: String
  fun handle(event: DomainEvent)
}
```

A few things to note:

1. We can declare mutiple AMQP entities in a `Declarables`. The don't need to be the same type.
2. `durable` means the entity will survive broker restart.

## `MessageListenerContainer`

So far we only declared desired entities in the broker, but haven't yet wired up our `DomainEventListener` to consume messages from the broker and perform business logic. To do so, we need to wrap our event handlers inside `MessageListenerContainer`.

`MessageListenerContainer` represents active or hot component. It handles connection to the the message broker and provides methods  for starting and stopping as a lifecycle component. For example, when connection is broken, `SimpleMessageListenerConainer` will try to restart the listener. Our domain event handlers are wrapped inside containers.

To facilitate programmatic registration of our domain listeners, we use te

See [Spring AMQP Reference ยง4.1.6](https://docs.spring.io/spring-amqp/docs/current/reference/html/#container)

## Messages are ephemeral

It's important to realize in the AMQP model, the message broker just acts as a postman between sender and receiver. It holds on to the messages only temporarily. On successful delivery to all consumers, usually the message is no longer available from the broker.

In contrast, Redis Stream and Kafka are more like databases. LSM Trees.

Some repercussions:

- It's easy to lose messages if something is misconfigured.  For example, a message published to an exhange with no bound queues will be dropped. Conceptually, it seems only queues in AMQP has a *memory*.
- No first-class support for doing CRUD on messages. For example, the web UI does not  have a list UI to display messages. It's possible to retrieve a few ones in the queue detail page, but it has a warning that says "getting messages from a queue is a destructive action." Although not necessarily always "destructive",  the action  causes side effective on the message.
- It is important to configure a `MessageRecoverer` in a `RetryInterceptor`. By default, the message will be dropped with a warning.

## Resillience

### Acknowledgement

Message consumers can fail at any time (due to business exception, dropped connection, application crash, etc). To prevent losing messages in this way, message brokers use acknowledgements: a message is removed from the broker only after the client acknowledges that it has processed it.

### Dead letter exchange

Laravel's [failed jobs](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/queues#dealing-with-failed-jobs) table is the same concept.

Suppose there is a mal-formed message. In our Spring application,  if our message handlers throw an exception, by default, the message will be requeued and delivered again, resulting in an infinite loop. A viable approach would be sending the bad message to other places for inspection after a few retries.

RabbitMQ can handle this situation by using [dead letter exchanges](https://www.rabbitmq.com/dlx.html). When our consumer negatively acknowledges a message, the queue will "dead-letter" the message (annotate with some infomation about the failure) and route it to the configured dead letter exchange. This configuration can be applied globally in the broker with a policy, or specified when creating a queue.

```bash
rabbitmqctl set_policy DLX ".*" '{"dead-letter-exchange":"my-dlx"}' --apply-to queues
```

You can also apply a policy in the RabbitMQ web UI under the "admin" tag.

Note that the dead letter exchange is just a regular exchange. If you specify a non-existent exchange, RabbitMQ does not create it automatically. This is the type of misconfiguration that can cause lost messages.

Configuration in Spring:

```kotlin
@Bean
fun deadLetterExchange() = DirectExchange("dlx")

@Bean
fun deadLetterQueues(
  listeners: List<DomainEventListener>
) = Declarables(
  val name = it::class.simpleName
  listeners.flatMap { // highlight-line
    val deadLetterQueue = QueueBuilder.durable("$name.dlq").build()
    val deadLetterBinding = BindingBuilder.bind(deadLetterQueue)
      .to(deadLetterExchange())
      .with(it.topic)

    listOf(deadLetterQueue, deadLetterBinding) // highlight-line
  }
)
```

We create a dead letter queue and it's binding to the configured `deadLetterExchange` for each listener. By properly configuring listening queues and bindings, we ensure dead letters don't get lost.

Also, we need to update our `queues()` code to configure the queues' dead letter exchange.

```kotlin
@Bean
fun deadLetterExchange() = DirectExchange("dlx")

@Bean
fun queues(listeners: List<DomainEventListener>) = Declarables(
  listeners.map {
    QueueBuilder.durable(it::class.simpleName)
      .withDeadLetterExchange(deadLetterExchange()) // highlight-line
      .build()
  }
)

private fun QueueBuilder.withDeadLetterExchange(exchange: Exchange): QueueBuilder =
  withArgument("x-dead-letter-exchange", exchange.name) // highlight-line
```

### Retry

```kotlin
@Bean
fun retryInterceptor() = RetryInterceptorBuilder()
  .stateless()
  .maxAttemtps(2)
  .backOffOptions(1000, 2.0, 10_000)
  .recoverer(RejectAndDontRequeueRecoverer())
  .build()
```
