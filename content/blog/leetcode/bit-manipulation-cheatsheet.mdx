## Get a bit

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
&0001&0111 \\
\And & 0000 & 000\textcolor{#EC407A}{1} \\ \hline
& 0000 & 0001
\end{array}
$$

### Get last bit

```java
n & 1
```

### Check if `n` is even

```java
n & 1 == 0
```

### Get bit at position `k`

```java
(n >> k) & 1
```

## Set / clear  a bit at position `k`

### Set a bit
$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
& 0001 & 0111 \\
\mathbin{|} & 0000 & \textcolor{#EC407A}{1}000 \\ \hline
& 0001 & 1111
\end{array}
$$

```java
n |= 1 << k
```

### Clear a bit

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
& 0001 & 0111 \\
\And & 1111 & 1\textcolor{#EC407A}{0}11 \\ \hline
& 0001 & 0011
\end{array}
$$

```java
n &= ~(1 << k)
```

### Toggle a bit

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
\verb!^! & 0 & 1 \\ \hline
       0 & 0 & 1 \\
       1 & 1 & \textcolor{#ec407a}{0}
\end{array}
$$

[[tip | üí°]]
| `^` is similar to `|` except that $1 xor 1 = 0$.

```java
n ^= 1 << n
```

## Masking

Write C expressions, in terms of variable `x`, for the following values.

The least significant byte of `x`, with all other bits set to $0$.

```c
x & 0xff
```

The least significant byte set to all ones, and all other bytes of `x` left unchanged.

```c
x | 0xff
```

## `n & (n - 1)` trick

[[tip | üõéÔ∏è]]
| `n & n - 1` has the effect of flipping the least significant $1$ bit of `n`.

You can use this trick to solve following LeetCode questions.

<LeetCode.ProblemCard id={191} thisSite={true} />

```java
public int hammingWeight(int n) {
  int ret = 0;
  for (; n != 0; n = n & (n - 1)) ret++Ôºõ
  return ret;
}
```

Notice in the decimal system, we write $10^n$ as $1$ followed by $n$ zeros.

By the same token, the binary representation of $2^n$ is $1$ followed by $n$ zeros.

```java
// Check if the number would turn to 0
// after flipping the least significant 1 bit.
public boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
  if (n == 0) return false;
  long N = (long) n;
  return (N & (N - 1)) == 0;
}
```

<LeetCode.ProblemCard id={342} />

To check if a number is a power of $4$, we first check if it's power of $2$ by applying the $n \And (n - 1)$ trick.
A power of $2$ number has only one $1$ bit.
If it's power of $4$, this $1$ bit must be followed by an even number of $0$ bits.
In other words, the $1$ bit must appear at even position of the binary representation.
We can use a bit mask to check if the 1 bit is at odd position. If so, it's *not* power of $4$.

```java
public boolean isPowerOfFour(int n) {
  if (n == 0) return false;
  long N = (long) n;
  return (N & (N - 1)) == 0
   && (N & 0xaaaaaaaa) == 0;
}
```

Note `0xa` is equivalent to `0b1010`.
